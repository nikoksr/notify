# Generic HTTP service

[![go.dev reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nikoksr/notify/service/http)

## Prerequisites

Technically, you don't need any prerequisites to use this service. However, you will need an HTTP endpoint to send requests to.

See our [Notify Test Server](https://github.com/nikoksr/notify-http-test) for a simple HTTP server that can be used for testing.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	stdhttp "net/http"

	"github.com/nikoksr/notify"
	"github.com/nikoksr/notify/service/http"
)

func main() {
	// Create http service
	httpService := http.New()

	//
	// In the following example, we will send two requests to the same HTTP endpoint. This is meant to be used with
	// Notify's test http server: https://github.com/nikoksr/notify-http-test. It supports multiple content-types on the
	// same endpoint, to simplify testing. All you have to do is run `go run main.go` in the test server's directory and
	// this example will work.
	// So the following example should send two requests to the same endpoint, one with content-type application/json and
	// one with content-type text/plain. The requests should be logged differently by the test server since we provide
	// a custom payload builder func for the second webhook.

	// Add a default webhook; this uses application/json as content type and POST as request method.
	httpService.AddReceiversURLs("http://localhost:8080")

	// Add a custom webhook; the build payload function is used to build the payload that will be sent to the receiver
	// from the given subject and message.
	httpService.AddReceivers(&http.Webhook{
		URL:         "http://localhost:8080",
		ContentType: "text/plain",
		Method:      stdhttp.MethodPost,
		BuildPayload: func(subject, message string) (payload any) {
			return "[text/plain]: " + subject + " - " + message
		},
	})

	//
	// NOTE: In case of an unsupported content type, we could provide a custom marshaller here.
	// See http.Service.Serializer and http.defaultMarshaller.Marshal for details.
	//

	// Add pre-send hook to log the request before it is sent.
	httpService.PreSend(func(ctx context.Context, req *stdhttp.Request) error {
		log.Printf("Sending request to %s", req.URL)
		return nil
	})

	// Add post-send hook to log the response after it is received.
	httpService.PostSend(func(ctx context.Context, req *stdhttp.Request, resp *stdhttp.Response) error {
		log.Printf("Received response from %s", resp.Request.URL)
		return nil
	})

	// Create the notifier and use the HTTP service
	n := notify.NewWithServices(httpService)

	// Send a test message.
	if err := n.Send(context.Background(), "Testing new features", "Notify's HTTP service is here."); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```
